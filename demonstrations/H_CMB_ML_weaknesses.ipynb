    "Look... I've worked ***really*** hard on this library. All of the work has been alleviating little frustrations. I think it works pretty well now. I've written the last several notebooks with the intention of explaining how the core of CMB-ML works.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I had to make this as I was learning. I'm not a long-time coder, and I've had to take a lot of cues from the sources close at hand. So there are many aspects of this work that I developed and then was stuck with. I've invented little ways to do things and figured out work-arounds. At the core, the issues persist. I hope to remedy some of these. Others I believe may be a part of the system until a total rework.\n",
