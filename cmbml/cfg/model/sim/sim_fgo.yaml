# Making simulations using "foreground only" maps
#    We take Planck's observations and subtract out Planck's predicted CMB. 
#    This is a stopgap measure to reduce the difference between sims and Planck.

defaults:
  - cmb:   wmap_cosmo_means
  # - noise: noise_corr_aniso_nonstat
  - noise: noise_spatial_corr
  # - noise: noise_variance
# PySM needs to run internal calculations at a resolution greater than the output nside (output nside set in experiment.yaml)

# PySM3 recommends either nside_sky=2048 for output_nside <= 1024; otherwise double it
#    While debugging code, it is often convenient to use lower resolution nside_sky
#    Only one of the two should be set. The other should be "null". Setting both may given unexpected results.
# Moved to top level for now
