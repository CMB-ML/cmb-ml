"""
This script runs a simulation pipeline for generating simulations based on a configuration.

The pipeline consists of several steps, including checking configurations, 
creating needed precursor assets (noise cache, configs, and theory power spectra), 
and creating the simulations.

The script uses the Hydra library for configuration management.

To run the simulation pipeline, execute the `run_simulations()` function.

Example usage:
    python main_sims.py

Note: This script requires the project to be installed, with associated libraries in pyproject.toml.
Note: This script may require the environment variable "CMB_SIMS_LOCAL_SYSTEM" to be set,
        or for appropriate settings in your configuration for local_system.
